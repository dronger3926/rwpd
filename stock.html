        <h4>A First-Time Traveler’s Guide to Rann Utsav 2023-2024</h4><br>
        <p>The Rann Utsav guide is intended for all travelers who have never been to Kutch but are eager to visit in the near future. Your journey through the sparkling white marshland will be remembered for a lifetime.</p>
        <p>The annual festival in Kutch is an expensive affair rather than a low-cost event. However, this does not preclude you from cutting costs and travelling on a budget. In this blog, I will try to provide you with the best Rann Utsav guide that will help you save money.</p>
        <p>The Kutch festival, also known as the Rann Utsav, is a journey that depicts the true culture of the Indian state of Gujarat, which I would like to show you in my current Rann Utsav guide. The Rann Utsav extravaganza creates an enchanting travel memory that you will remember for a long time. The festival’s uniqueness complements the spectacular boundless white desert.</p>
        <p>The advertisement for Gujarat Tourism featuring Amitabh Bachchan (the Bollywood superstar who is the official ambassador of the Indian state of Gujarat) saying “Kuch nahi dekha toh kuch nahi dekha” (if you haven’t seen Kutch, you haven’t seen anything) must have been seen by Indian travellers. His advertisement undoubtedly makes viewers consider the Kutch region and how to plan a trip there!</p>
        <p>As a traveller, if you’re wondering, “What is Rann Utsav?” Why is Kutch associated with Rann Utsav? How to plan a trip to the Rann of Kutch, and so on, my current Rann Utsav Guide will help you visit this wonderful region and attend the cultural event.</p>

        <h4>Rann Utsav Guide for Travelers</h4>
        <p>If you are a first-time visitor to the Kutch region, it is critical that you not only understand the intricacies of this very different region, but also connect well with the festival.</p>
        <p>In order for you to have a better experience as a traveller, I’ve listed the most important things you should know as a visitor to the Rann Utsav ahead of time.</p><br>

        <h4>What is the Rann Utsav?</h4>
        <p>Rann refers to a salty marshland, and Utsav means festival in Hindi. As a result, Rann Utsav refers to a salty marsh festival (in the Kutch region of Gujarat).</p>
        <p>“Rann Utsav is an awesome festival of Kutch, Gujarat, India,” according to their official website. When you visit under the full Moon, it is a Carnival of Music, Dance, the natural beauty of White Rann, and much more.” The Tourism Department of the west Indian state of Gujarat organises the Rann Utsav.</p>
        <p>It is an intriguing tourism concept that showcases the rebuilt desert region of Kutch following the 2001 Earthquake by creating a travel story that connects Kutch’s geographical and cultural distinctions.

            The Rann Utsav promises a treat for everyone, with premium tents at Dhordo village, camel rides, and daily trips to the Great Rann and nearby villages rich in craft and folk traditions, old temples, and historical landmarks.</p>

        <h5>When is the Rann Utsav Celebrated?</h5><br>
        <p>Every year, from November to February, the Rann Utsav is held. The four-month-long festivities at the world’s largest seasonal salt marshland attract visitors from all over the world.</p>
        <p>The announced dates for the current festival are from 1st November 2023 to 25th February 2024</p> <br>
        
        <h3>What is the Tent City?</h3><br>
        <img src="/image/tent.jpg" width="60%" style="box-shadow: 2px 4px 3px 2px black;"/><br><br>
        <p>The Tent City is where the Rann Utsav takes place. It is located in Dhordo and has been fortified by the Gujarat Tourism Department. The reason for this is that they clearly do not want to enter without paying.

            This is now discouraging for many travellers. However, in their defence, they require revenue each year to promote tourism in their “less visited” state.</p>
            <h4>Is the Accommodation at Tent City good?</h4>
            <p>Well, I would definitely say that the tent city is the best place to get the full Rann of Kutch festival experience (that is why you pay for it).<br> As we all know, staying in the Tent City is quite expensive, but the money is well spent.

                It has a 24-hour hot water supply, room heaters and air conditioners to combat the extreme temperatures, a marketplace, and two dining halls. As a result, you will find the tent city to be very comfortable and convenient.</p>
                <br>
        <h4>Official Permission for Entering the Salt Desert of Kutch </h4>
        <p>Because of its proximity to the Pakistani border, the Salt Desert is considered a sensitive area and requires permission to enter.

            Written permission is required, which can be obtained along the way at the Bhirandiyara village checkpoint (famous for mawa, a milk-based sweet).</p>        
        <p>The permit costs 100 INR per person and 50 INR for a car. One must submit a photocopy of the ID proof as well as the original. Permission can also be obtained from the Gujarat Police DSP office in Bhuj, close to Jubilee Ground (closed on Sundays and every second and fourth Saturday).</p>
        <br><h4>
            Will you be treated well?

        </h4>
        <p>If you have less time to plan the entire trip and some extra cash to spend, this is a great option. Your entire trip is meticulously planned, from airport pickup to drop-off. The staff is extremely courteous, and the tents are fantastic.</p>
